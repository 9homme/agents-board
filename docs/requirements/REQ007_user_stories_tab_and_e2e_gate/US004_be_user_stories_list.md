# US004/be_user_stories_list

**Requirement:** REQ007
**Story:** US004
**Track:** BE
**Service:** services/agent-board
**Status:** pending
**Blocked by:** 
**Worked-by:** 
**Implements:** US004, API contract GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/user-stories, Data model (ListUserStoriesWithTaskCount query)

## Goal
Implement the read-only REST endpoint to list a project's user stories with their task counts and descriptions.

## Scope
- **In:** `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/user-stories` endpoint. `ListUserStoriesWithTaskCount` repo method.
- **Out:** Single story detail endpoint. Tasks endpoint.

## Files touched (estimated, exclusive)
- `services/agent-board/internal/handler/user_story_handler.go`
- `services/agent-board/internal/handler/user_story_handler_test.go`
- `services/agent-board/internal/repo/user_story_repo.go`
- `services/agent-board/internal/repo/user_story_repo_test.go`
- `services/agent-board/cmd/api-server/main.go`

## Test contract
The dev must make these tests pass:
- (Track: BE) from `US004_be_unit_tests.md`: All applicable UT and IT tests.

## Implementation notes
- `ListUserStoriesWithTaskCount` must use `LEFT JOIN tasks t ON t.user_story_id = us.id` and `GROUP BY us.id`.
- DTO must match the exact JSON contract in architecture: `{"userStories": [{id, projectId, title, description, status, taskCount, createdAt, updatedAt}]}`.
- Wire the handler in `cmd/api-server/main.go`.

## Definition of done
- All listed tests green.
- (Track: BE) `go vet ./...` and `go test ./...` clean inside the task's service module.
- (Track: BE) `go test -coverprofile=/tmp/cov.out ./... && go tool cover -func=/tmp/cov.out` — every production `.go` file in this task's `## Files touched` clears ≥ 80% line coverage, OR the task has a written `## Coverage exemption` section justifying each below-threshold file.
- No new public exports / public components without a doc comment.
- Code matches the cited architecture entries (no silent deviation).
- **Review gate green:** `scripts/review/run-gate.sh be services/agent-board` exits 0 AND emits `REVIEW GATE: PASS` on stdout. Also `scripts/review/run-gate.sh cross` exits 0 AND emits `REVIEW GATE: PASS`. If the REQ has Robot e2e suites, `robot --dryrun tests/e2e/REQ007_*/` also passes.
- Dev set status to `in_review` and reported back.
